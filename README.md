# Temperature-analysis
An exploratory analysis of an historical temperature dataset, focused on Nigeria.

The data sourcing notebook was used to get the historical temperature data through the cds api and then average into decades and also yearly, as needed for the analysis.
The MLnotebook was used to perform a timeseries forecasting on each cell, separately. ArcGIS timeseries forecasting had been used earlier but i decided to explore the ARIMA model.
